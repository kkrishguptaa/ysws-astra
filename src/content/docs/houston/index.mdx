Astra YSWS is a program by <a href="https://hackclub.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackClub</a> where you ship an Astro website and we ship `???`

Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. Astro helps you build fast, content-focused websites with a modern developer experience. It allows you to use your favorite UI frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, and more, while optimizing for performance.

## Requirements

To claim the `WS` prize, you need to meet the following requirements:

- You should have at least 3 pages on your website.
- You should use at least 2 different UI frameworks on your website. (Astro counts! So you can use Astro + React, React + Svelte, etc.)
- Each UI framework should have at least 2 components you have built. You are free to use other components from the framework's ecosystem.
- Use one Astro integration other than UI frameworks. Examples include:
  - `@astrojs/markdoc` for Markdown support
  - `@astrojs/mdx` for MDX support
  - `@astrojs/sitemap` for generating sitemaps
  - Any deployment integration like `@astrojs/vercel`, `@astrojs/netlify`, etc.
- Your site should be deployed and publicly accessible. (You can deploy static sites on GitHub Pages, and SSR sites on Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, etc.)

**Note:** You can use Starlight as long as you meet the requirements above. Starlight is a documentation site generator built on Astro, and it can be used to create documentation sites with Astro.
